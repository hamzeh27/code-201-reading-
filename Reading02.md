describe both headings and paragraphs.

# CSS:
**CSS** allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
* A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.  
*Selectors* indicate which element the rule applies to.  
*Declarations* indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a **property** and a **value**, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
