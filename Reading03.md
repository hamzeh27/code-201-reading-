# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML Lists

In HTML there are three different types of lists, which are:

1. Ordered Lists

- They are very self explanatory, allows you to order items in an organized way, 1, 2, 3 and so on.

2. Unordered lists

- Same case here, allows you to list items in an unorganized way.

3. Definition lists

- Definition lists are like unordered lists, but they allow you to add a definiation for the listed item, usually a big text or a simple explaination.


Also, lets not forget about nested lists: those lists can be any type of list, but they are also lists aswell, in other words, they are lists inside of other lists.



## CSS Box Model

HTML  uses box model, which is like giving each element its own box to help organize web page elements by repostioning, scaling and controling the dimensions of the box.

The Boxs are made of 3 different things, The Margin, The Border & The Padding.


 **Margin**

The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.

 *Border*

The border separates the edge of one box from another

**Padding**

The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.









## Control Flow With Js

Control Flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated, Also control flow statement is a statement that results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow. For non-strict functional languages.

To control the flow of code or in other words, to compare 2 expressions or more, there are alot of operators that serve this purpose, such as If Statements, Switch Statements and Loops.
