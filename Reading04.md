# HTML & CSS
## layout
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
  - Block-level elements start on a new line
  - Inline elements flow in between surrounding text
- Containing Elements :If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element
  - It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div>
- CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: 
  - normal flow:Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down
  - relative positioning:This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.
  - absolute positioning:This positions the element in relation to its containing element (it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements).
- **box offset** properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.
  - Fixed Positioning : Elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page.
  - Floating Elements : Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box
- The *z-index* property allows you to control which box appears on top.
- Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
- When the position property is given a value of absolute,the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.
  - Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed
- we can Use Float to Place Elements Side-by-Side
- float values :
  - clear: to say that no element should touch the left or righthand sides of a box.
  - left: The left-hand side of the box should not touch any other elements appearing in the same containing element.
  - right: The right-hand side of the box will not touch elements appearing in the same containing element.
  - both: Neither the left nor right-hand sides of the box will touch elements appearing in the same containing element.
  - none: Elements can touch either side.
- parents of Floated Elements Problem :
  - If a containing element only contains floated elements, some browsers will treat it as if it is zero pixels tall
- solution :
  - adds two CSS rules to the containing element :
    - The overflow property is given a value auto.
    - The width property is set to 100%.
- Many web pages use multiple columns in their design. This is achieved by using a `<div>` element to represent each column. The following three CSS properties are used to position the columns next to each other:
  - width This sets the width of the columns.
  - float This positions the columns next to each other.
  - margin This creates a gap between the columns.
- Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
- **Resolution**: refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch
- the higher the resolution, the smaller the text appears.
- designers assumed that users would see the top 570-600 pixels of a page without having to scroll and some tried to fit all of the key messages in this area
- The area of the page that users would see without scrolling was often referred as being “above the fold”
- **Liquid layout**: designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
  - The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.
- To create a fixed width layout,the width of the main boxes on a page will usually be specified in pixels

- Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers
- Grids set consistent proportions and spaces between items which helps to create a professional looking design.
- CSS Frameworks :aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. 
  - You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch
  - ADVANTAGES :
    1- They save you from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks.
    2- They will have been tested across different browser versions
  - disadvantages :
    1- They often require that you use class names in your HTML code that only control the presentation of the page
    2- In order to satisfy a wide variety of needs, they often contain more code than you need for your particular web page
- **960.gs ** :provides a style sheet that you can include in your HTML pages
- The 960.gs style sheet has taken care of the layout, creating the correct width for the columns and setting the spaces between them.
***960.gs rule*** :
  - Control the font and the position of the text in the boxes
  - Set the background colors for the boxes
  - Set the height of the feature and article boxes
  - Add a margin to the top and bottom of each box

- There are two ways to add multiple style sheets to a page:
  - use the @import rule to import other style sheets.
  - you can use a separate `<link>` element for each style sheet.

# js

- Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
**Functions **: series of statement that grouped together to perform specific task.
  - If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.
  - **calling** :ask the function to perform its task you need to give your function a name.
  - **parameters** :information provided to the function to perform task
  - **return value** :the answer you expect from function
  - ** argument**: is the value that is sent to the function when it is called

  - syntax :``` function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
} ```
  - to call function: myfunction(p1_value,p2_value)
**method **:same as function but methods are created inside object
**objects**: are made up of properties and methods

**scope**: The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code
  - dpending on scope there are two type of variable :
    1- LOCAL VARIABLES :the variable is availabel within specific scope not anywhere
    2- GLOBAL VARIABLES :it can be used anywhere within the script
- Global variables use more memory browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded
- Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed

# pair programming 
pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. 
The *Driver* is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard
The *Navigator* uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
- **Why pair program?**
1. Greater efficiency:Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer,
 but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging
  When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own.
2. Engaged collaboration:When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.
 When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help
3. Learning from fellow students: If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.
 The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance
4. Social skills:Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills.
5. Job interview readiness :For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills.
 Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.
6. Work environment readiness: Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. 
Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job,
 with one less hurdle to overcome
