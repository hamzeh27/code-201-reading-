# JS Object Literals, The DOM
## JS Object Literals
**- What Is JavaScript Object Literals:** 
* Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.
*  In an object variables become known as properties.
*  In an object function become known as methods in an object function.  


**- Object Literal Syntax:**
* Object literals are defined using the following syntax rules:
1. A colon separates property name from value.
2. comma separates each name-value pair from the next.
3. A comma after the last name-value pair is optional. 

* An example for **object literal syntax**:

* you can access the propertys or the methods of an object like shown below:

## the DOM (Document Object Model)

**-The Dom (Document Object Model):**
* The Dom (**D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
* The Dom (**D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.


**- The HTML DOM (Document Object Model):**
* The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for *HTML*, it defines:
1. The *HTML* elements as **objects**
2. The **properties** of all *HTML* elements.
3. The **methods** to access all *HTML* elements.
4. The **events** for all *HTML* elements.

* With the **HTML DOM**, **JavaScript** can access and change all the elements of an *HTML document*.
* When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel of the page.
* The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

* With the **object model**, **JavaScript** gets all the power it needs to create *dynamic HTML*:
1. **JavaScript** can change all the **HTML** elements in the page.
2. **JavaScript** can change all the **HTML** attributes in the page.
3. **JavaScript** can change all the **CSS** styles in the page.
4. **JavaScript** can remove existing **HTML** elements and attributes.
5. **JavaScript** can add new **HTML** elements and attributes.
6. **JavaScript** can react to all existing **HTML** events in the page.
7. **JavaScript** can create new **HTML** events in the page.
