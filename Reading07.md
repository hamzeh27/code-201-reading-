# Domain Modeling

*Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.*
*A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.*
*An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an **object-oriented** model.*

## Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the `new` keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from **outside**.
6. Use the `this` variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from **inside**.
    
    
    
# Table
*** The <table element is used to create a table.***
** The contentsof the table are written out row by row.**
* The tr stands for table row.*
* The td stands for table data.*
